## ✨ What is Soc Ops?

Soc Ops (Social Operations) transforms awkward mixer moments into engaging conversations. Instead of standing around wondering what to talk about, players explore the room seeking connections through fun prompts like:

- 🚴 "bikes to work"
- 🌍 "has lived in another country"
- 🎸 "plays an instrument"
- 🗣️ "speaks more than 2 languages"

**The goal?** Find people who match each prompt, tap the square, and get 5 in a row to win!
